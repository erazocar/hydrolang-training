# Introduction

## Overview

HydroLang is a library that contains four modules, each tailored to specific needs in environmental sciences. Each library contains methods (functions) that follow a specific format to create a unique structure that can be easily replicated for new additions and formats. It is a library tailored towards:

- Development of web applications through an intuitive API.
- Used as a direct point of work for the development of scientific research in a web browser.
- As part of larger web systems development.

It has been developed with an object-oriented approach, in which each module contains methods that are directly called through JavaScript's object notation. The modules themselves can be used conjointly; however, they are loosely coupled and highly scalable, making it easy to learn and use directly from the web browser.

HydroLang's function best practices have been updated to adopt JavaScript's ES6 object destructuring, in which major separations for functional arguments can be understood:

- `params`  general configurations required for a function (e.g., proxy servers in the data functions, sources, etc.).
- `args` specific configurations for a function (e.g., how many steps to execute in a function).
- `data` data associated with the function run. Most of the functions deal with 1D arrays; however, ND arrays can also be used or other data structures.
